Q1)I only saw one thing, but read.csv() appears to set "header" to true automatically.
Q2)The main difference I saw was that the delimiter for csv1 is a comma and csv2 was a semicolon.
Q3)I don't know which files do this, but apparently some are stored as colon seperated values instead of comma seperated values. You could not load these directly in without csv2.
Q4)Perhaps you meant change it from character to factor, but I will stick with what the question says.
df <-  read.csv("../../Data/landdata-states.csv", colClasses = c(State = "character"))
# I inserted an extra field colClasses = c(columnnamehere = "desiredtype")
Q5)summary(df$Home.Value)
Q6) It gives me the first row in the fourth column, which is "Home.Value"
Q7) I get an error, but I think you may be referring to col = orange or some color like that. It changes colors.
